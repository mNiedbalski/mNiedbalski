<h1> Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> </h1>
<p>  My name is Micha≈Ç Niedbalski and I'm currently studing Informatics at the Silesian Technical University. </p>
<h1> About me <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72338271/119031305-40a47d00-b9ab-11eb-8264-9d5dfb6bf907.gif" width="35px"> </h1>

<p> At the moment I'm expanding my knowledge concerning the C++ language. In the nearest future I would like to try collaborating on a programming project with other people
  to learn how to cooperate in the programming facet. </p> 
  
<h1> Programs that I have completed <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72338271/119033984-2c15b400-b9ae-11eb-86db-f82c071bd491.gif" width="50px"> </h1>

Basically this program simulates living cycles of individuals in which they reproduce and in which they also die. Everything depends on the given data by user. </p>

<p> Darwin is the most advanced problem that I have done. The process of this program can be listed as below: <br>
<ul> 
  <li> User provides the program with data, like: 
    <ul>
     <li> Number of k-pairs chosen to reproduce </li>
     <li> Number of p-generations </li>
     <li> Extinction factor that belongs to the interval <0,1> </li>
     <li> Reproduction factor that belongs to the interval <0,1> </li>
     <li> Name of the input file</li>
     <li> Name of the output file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Every inputted parameter is being checked whether it is in correct format or not. If something is wrong a simple instruction pops up. </li>
  <li> Program saves the data from the file in order to operate on it </li>
    <ul>
      <li> The data is stored in this format: <br> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72338271/119059676-1665b600-b9d1-11eb-9021-e213859cab2b.png"> <br> Every sequence of numbers is just a genetic code of a specific individual. </li>
    </ul>
  <li> k-individuals are chosen from the population and the outcome of their reproduction are two another individuals. <br> More or less it means that process of the crossing-over is happening. It can be depicted as below: <br> <img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72338271/119060582-c2f46780-b9d2-11eb-9c4d-c0341766a3cb.png">
</li>
  
</ul>
