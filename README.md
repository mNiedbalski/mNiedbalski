<p> Cinema Management. Web application made in 5 people team. My task was to create frontend of our web application. We were using Angular+Bootstrap 14, .NET Core 6 and Entity Framework. <br> Link to the repository: https://github.com/StartupZmitac/ZMiTACinema</p>
<p> Climb Together. Program created for commercial usage. The point of this program is to track users' progress in climbing and to provide crucial analytical data to gym owners. This data can help to adjust gym's amenities based on clients.</p>
<p> Firm management. Program that can be used to manage a firm. Everything is based on a project pattern called composite - every branch can have other branches below in hierarchy. As administrator You can add branches, alter salaries, add new workers, give promotions etc.  </p>

Basically this program simulates living cycles of individuals in which they reproduce and in which they also die. Everything depends on the given data by user.</p>

<p> Darwin is a program in which genetic algorithm was implemented. The process of this program can be listed as below: <br>
<ul> 
  <li> User provides the program with data, like: 
    <ul>
     <li> Number of k-pairs chosen to reproduce </li>
     <li> Number of p-generations </li>
     <li> Extinction factor that belongs to the interval <0,1> </li>
     <li> Reproduction factor that belongs to the interval <0,1> </li>
     <li> Name of the input file</li>
     <li> Name of the output file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Every inputted parameter is being checked whether it is in correct format or not. If something is wrong a simple instruction pops up. </li>
  <li> Program saves the data from the file in order to operate on it </li>
    <ul>
      <li> The data is stored in this format: <br> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72338271/119059676-1665b600-b9d1-11eb-9021-e213859cab2b.png"> <br> Every sequence of numbers is just a genetic code of a specific individual. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li> 2 individuals are chosen from the population and the outcome of their reproduction are two another individuals. <br> More or less it means that the process of crossing-   over is happening. 
  <ul>
    <li> It can be depicted as below: <br> <img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72338271/119060582-c2f46780-b9d2-11eb-9c4d-c0341766a3cb.png"> </li>
    <li> This process is repeated k-times </li> 
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Every individual is getting assigned a factor of survival. It is calculated using the value of it's genetic code elements. </li>
  <ul>
      <li>This factor determines whether an individual will be extinct, or will it continue to reproduce in further generations, or will it just exist. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Previous steps (excluding those before reading data from files) are repeated p-times </li>
  <li> Whole population is being saved on a text file that is the final outcome of this program </li>
</ul>
